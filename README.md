# Fetch-Unit-Testing

Practice Testing Fetch

For your practice of this section you're going:

    to create a new repo called: " Fetch-Unit-Testing "
    . clone the repo into your jsDev folder/directory
    npm init Enter, enter, enter, enter, enter....
    npm install -g mocha
    Build a simple GUI app that uses this api: https://punkapi.com/documentation/v2.
    use the video above to walk through building two tests for this simple app; 1 for a single beer and 1 for 10 beers.
    You should end up with a simple GUI app that has at least two unit test injected into your fetch request.
